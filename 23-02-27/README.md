# 27th february - sunny day (!)

* checking how random number generators are built - with _Random Number Generation and Monte Carlo Methods_ by Gentle - simply, in python

* going back to goodfellow's take on probability, perhaps leverage pytorch to generate some distributions and look at them, and get a hold of mixture models

* some of goodfellow's take on information theory, numerical analysis and machgine learning!
